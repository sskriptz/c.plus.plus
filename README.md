# 💻 C++ Projects & Experiments

Welcome to my repository of **C++ programs**, **practice exercises**, **mini-projects**, and **experiments**.  
This repo serves as a collection of everything I build while learning, practicing, or exploring C++ concepts — from simple algorithms to more advanced systems.

## 📘 What’s Inside

This repository includes a variety of C++ work, such as:

- 🧮 **Algorithms & data structures**
- 🎲 **Randomization and simulations**
- 📝 **Text processing experiments**
- 🧩 **Problem-solving exercises**
- 🌐 **Small utilities or prototypes**
- 🔬 **Concept demonstrations** (pointers, OOP, recursion, parsing, etc.)

Each folder or file typically represents a standalone project or test program.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **C++17 / C++20** (depending on the file)
- Standard Template Library (**STL**)
- `g++` / `clang++`
- Common headers used:
  - `<vector>`
  - `<map>`
  - `<algorithm>`
  - `<random>`
  - `<sstream>`
  - `<fstream>`

## ▶️ How to Compile & Run

To compile a single file:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp -o program
./program
```

To compile multiple files in a project:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o program
./program
```

## 📂 Repository Structure

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

This repository exists to:

- Track progress in C++
- Practice new concepts
- Store reusable utilities
- Experiment with algorithms
- Build small prototypes quickly
- Serve as a reference for future work

## 🤝 Contributions

This is primarily a personal learning repo,  
but suggestions, optimizations, or pull requests are welcome.
